Task 3 of AI & ML Internship by Elevate Labs

i choose Housing.csv data set to perform task
code editor is jupiter notbook

1.Import and preprocess the dataset.
- import data and and replace all yes to 1 and no to 0 for performing regression

2.Split data into train-test sets.
- create variable on Indipendent variable(all numeric data) and dependent variable(house price)
- perform split on data and set 20% of data as a test data

3.Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
- import sklearn lode leniear_model and perform LinearRegression on it
- and fiting it into training data (X_train,y_train)
  
4.Evaluate model using MAE, MSE, RÂ².
- by the using of metrics fild all 3 values MAE,MSE, R_square
  
5.Plot regression line and interpret coefficients.
- plot line chart(scatterplot) and find all interpret coefficients
